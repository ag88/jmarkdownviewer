# ![Markdown](markdown.png "Markdown") &nbsp; Markdown and ![AsciiDoc](AsciiDoc-color.png "AsciiDoc") Viewer
---

This is a Markdown viewer for java. Primarily it tries to display github styled markdown scripts.

## Notes / limitations

- Rendering of images and other html features is based on available features in Java
Swing. This generally support image formats such as jpg, png and gif. Unsupported image formats would be rendered with a broken image icon.

- Last but not least Java and Java Swing itself. The html renderer isn't quite the most feature packed but is a mature implementation.
